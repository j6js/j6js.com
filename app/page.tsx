          About Me
        </h2>
        <p className="text-violet-950 dark:text-violet-200 text-noto">
          Kia ora, I&apos;m Jackson. I&apos;m a high school student, who has a keen interest in all things technology. Since I was a small
          child, I have always been interested in systems and how they work.
          Whenever I see some sort of system or a piece of technology, I always
          think about how something works and the process of it getting there.
          Over countless hours of reading, watching videos and talking to
          people, I have managed to aquire lots of knowledge on almost any tech related topic.
          <br />
          <br />
          One thing that became an interest was programming, as it was a way to
          create things, and some really advanced systems. One thing I
          especially like about computers (mainly programming), is that it is
          able to do extremely advanced things, like predicting the
          weather, or even controlling something, on the other side of the
          world with almost no delay. <br />
          <br />
          Since September 2024, I have been learning HTML, CSS, and now
          JavaScript with freeCodeCamp. One day before school ended in 2024, I
          received a certification for Responive Web Design, from freeCodeCamp.
          Alongside their curriculum, I have been experimenting with TypeScript,
          and mainly Next.js. I am now trying out my first real project in Next.js. That project would be this
          website.

          Sometimes I might work on a personal side-project, but usually I help
          out with something for my school. I have worked on a few projects, and
          I have helped with a lot of events and other projects in my school
          life.
